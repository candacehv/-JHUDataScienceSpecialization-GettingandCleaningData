* Johns Hopkins Coursera Data Science Specialization - Getting and Cleaning Data, course #3


This repo contains one script - the run_analysis.r script, which intakes raw data from the UCI HAR Dataset, and transforms the data into a single, tidy summary of raw data collected on each subject, for each activity, as documented in the data. (See CodeBook for variable, data, and transformation information.)

The final summarized data is produced in a document called final_data.txt. 

Raw data can be downloaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  (See dataset license info below)
